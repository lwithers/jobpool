# jobpool

`jobpool` is a command line tool (with an automatically launched backing daemon)
to launch and control pools of jobs from a shell script. It can be used to
manage and wait for a number of parallel background jobs, and to limit the
number of jobs.

## Job limits

While it is active, `jobpool` monitors the system load average every 0.2s . When
the load average is below NUM_CPUS+2 (configurable), an existing job will be
unpaused or a new job started. When the load average goes above NUM_CPUSÃ—2
(again configurable), one running job will be paused.

In effect many jobs can be queued and, while the system is coping, more and
more will be started. This happens quite quickly, to allow coping with launching
a lot of non-CPU-bound commands at once.

As the system becomes more loaded, existing jobs are paused (and new ones not
started). However `jobpool` tries to keep the CPUs loaded on the system to
use available resources as efficiently as possible.

## Examples

### Create a pool, add some jobs, wait for completion

This is the normal flow expected to be used for a shell script. A pool is
created and jobs are added to it. We then wait for completion. The user can
query the pool's status.

```
~ $ jobpool create "label"
label-1
~ $ jobpool run --pool "label-1" "echo foo > /dev/null"
~ $ jobpool run --pool "label-1" sleep 20
~ $ jobpool ls --pool "label-1"
label-1: 1 finished, 0 failed, 1 in progress
finished [success]: echo foo > /dev/null
in progress: sleep 20
~ $ jobpool wait --pool "label-1" # will wait for the sleep to exit
label-1: 2 finished, 0 failed, 0 in progress
finished [success]: echo foo > /dev/null
finished [success]: sleep 20
~ $ echo $?
0
```

### Pool behaviour on failure

This shows the default fast-fail behaviour when a job within the pool fails.
Any other running jobs will be aborted, so that the final wait will be returned
immediately.

```
~ $ jobpool create "label"
label-2
~ $ jobpool run --pool "label-2" sleep 20
~ $ jobpool run --pool "label-2" ">&2 echo some message && false"
~ $ jobpool run --pool "label-2" sleep 30
~ $ jobpool wait --pool "label-2" # will return immediately
label-2: 0 finished, 2 failed, 0 in progress
failed [aborted]: sleep 20
failed [exit code 1]: false
failed [aborted]: sleep 30
	some message
```
